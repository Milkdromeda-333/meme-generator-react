# meme-generator-react
<br>
This is a project where I used bootstrap and React.js to build a meme generator. Here's what I learned from the process: <br>
- If you can't find the solution, hack it. Find some way to emulate the solution. (using outline-offset if i cant get the outline to stop hiding). <br>
- Search high and low for the solution to your problems/bugs. <br>
- How to make an offcanvas component in Bootstrap 5 <br>
- How to use bootstrap icons <br>
- How to put text over an image using CSS. <br>
- I practiced making components in React and passed props through them. <br>

Problems: <br>
- I couldn't figure out how to condistionally style my components based on a prop passed to it. <br>
- Not sure how to make the entire site responsive.
