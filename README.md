# meme-generator-react
<br>
This is a project where I used bootstrap and React.js to build a meme generator. <br><br>
Here's what I learned from the process: <br>
- If you can't find the solution, hack it. Find some way to emulate the solution. (using outline-offset if i cant get the outline to stop hiding). <br>
- Search high and low for the solution to your problems/bugs. <br>
- How to make an offcanvas component in Bootstrap 5 <br>
- How to use bootstrap icons <br>
- How to put text over an image using CSS. <br>
- I practiced making components in React and passed props through them.  <br>
- when debugging, do step-by-step run-through of the part of the code infected, and make sure each step is doing what it's intended to do.<br>
- when problem solving and you need to ask google but you're unsure of how to form a question, slow down and think about a broader way to ask the question, or a broader way to ask for what youre looking for, take a step back or two from the exact words/explaination if needed to get a more general answer.<br>
- And, if you're reading docs or extremely technical text, slow down and try to extract info from the material.<br><br>
Problems: <br>
- I couldn't figure out how to condistionally style my components based on a prop passed to it. <br>
- Not sure how to make the entire site responsive.
